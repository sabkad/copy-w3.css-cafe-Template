# copy-w3.css-cafe-Template

This website was built for educational purposes only.
The design was taken from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp">W3.CSS Website Templates</a> tutorial.

Although the design is pretty simple, I'd like to add it as a sign of appreciation for each step I do in this little journey. 

Still, there are some results to share:
1. I learned to create tabs, which is a quite usefull thing to know. I did it with accordance to instuctions I found here https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp. 
   However, I have a vague feeling that this stuff is a bit outdated. 
2. I continue practicing HTML and CSS skills. And it sometimes happens to learn some JS tricks along the way.
